            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE AUTHORS Preface TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>I Have choſen no Patron for this little Book, becauſe every one is a Patron of this ſin. Courteous Reader, thou ſhalt find nothing here but what is thine own, <hi>i. e.</hi> thine own Iniquity, God who is thy Judge will lay no claim to it, for 'tis none of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, he never made it, neither is it to be
<pb facs="tcp:45656:3" rendition="simple:additions"/> found in the whole Inventory of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the Devil thy Accuſer will lay it at thy door, as thy proper own, for though he have acted the part of a Midwife to help thee to bring it forth into the World alive, yet will he accuſe thee for it, as the ſpawn that was firſt engendered in thy wicked and corrupt nature, after thy fall and defection from thy God; and thine own Conſcience thy witneſs will alſo teſtifie that it is thine own. I know it is an hard matter in this old and hold faſt age of the World, to perſwade any man to part with what is his own; Men being generally as covetous of ſin as they are of riches, deſiring rather to partake of other mens ſins, than to part with their own. And as it is a difficult task that I have undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, ſo alſo a task that will bring much hatred upon me, for none love that others ſhould tell them of the faults of their own Children; ſo muſt I expect to be cenſured by others for cenſuring other mens ſins; and perhaps pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded againſt as an Eves dropper, for ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo near to every mans heart, and liſtning what is ſaid or done in the private Cloſet of every manS Conſcience. But Reader I would have thee know, that I come not to Father
<pb facs="tcp:45656:3"/> any Child upon thee, but what I will prove, even from the Teſtimony of Scripture to be thine own; if thou be aſhamed of it, why doſt thou ſtill keep it; if thou be not aſhamed of it, be not angry with me for diſcovering it. Again, though I tell the whole World of it, it is only to affright thee out of it. The diſcovery of a mans ſecret ſin, is half way towards the recovery of his periſhing Soul: Seeing therefore what I do is only for thy good, be perſwaded to take it in good part. Beſides, whatever thou findeſt to be thy own in my Book, I give thee free leave to challenge it. He that concealeth another man's goods from him is a Thief; but he that revealeth another man's ſin to him is his beſt friend. If thou be one that will but ſpare the time and take the pains to ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy thine own heart, thou wilt find all that is in this Book, and much more written there in a larger Volume, and thine own Conſcience like <hi>Joſeph</hi> (if thou wilt but hearken to it) will tell thee far worſe tales of this thine Iniquity, than I am able to report unto thee. It is the Lords Candle wherewith I have ſearched thy dark heart, elſe I could never have made this diſcovery, and though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps

The true Faſt is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from ſin and wickedneſs, for every one of us to amend our ways and lives: I have likewiſe preſſed upon you Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as a neceſſary duty, that ought to

Read 26. <hi>Leviticus</hi>
23, 24. I come now as an addition to what I have formerly ſpoken, to ſhew you the way and means to a right Reformation, and that is, every one of us muſt follow <hi>Davids</hi> example in the Text, to keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from his own Iniquity <hi>i. e.</hi> every one muſt amend one, and then we ſhall the ſooner amend all.

                  <hi>hen-begnavon cholalti,</hi> the ſame word in the Text, which is the Iniquity <hi>David</hi> calls his Iniquity, even that Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wherein he was formed and born, this he kept himſelf from. Here's the root of all ſin, look to the corruption of Nature, dry up the Fountain look eſpecially to this ſin. Thus you ſee the Emphaſis of the Text, and <hi>Junius</hi> Tranſlation may well ſerve for a good Comment upon it, he that keeps himſelf from this, keeps him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from all ſin; all other endeavours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt other ſins, to wit actual are nothing unleſs you look to your Natures. To ſuffer this ſin, namely, original corruption to eſcape and ſtrive againſt other ſins, is no better than for a Magiſtrate to give Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to ſet up many Ale-houſes, the cauſes of drunkenneſs, and then be ſtrict to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh thoſe that are drunk.</p>
               <p>This is the continual running iſſue in the Soul, the ſin that lies always in our
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45656:22"/> boſoms and is continually with us, this is the Iniquity of the Soul, againſt which we ought eſpecially to watch and be upon our guard, as Sentinels in a Watch-tower, that are always looking when the Enemy comes, that they may not be unprepared for him, ſo let us preſerve our ſelves from this ſin, and ſtrive to make right and ſtraight theſe our crooked Natures, and then ſhall we be preſerved from all danger of ſin, and ſhew our uprightneſs and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in the ſight of God, and walk in the ſtraight paths of his Commandments.</p>
               <p>We ought to take care of other mens ſins, but above all we ought to have a care of our own ſins. I will explain the Text by a ſimilitude, <hi>Sampſon</hi> was very careful to avoid the
<hi>Philiſtines,</hi> he always eyed and watched the <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> and they could do him no hurt; oh but <hi>Sampſon</hi> had a
<hi>Philiſtin,</hi> a <hi>Dalilah</hi> that lay in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
<hi>Sampſon</hi> was not careful of her, and ſhe at laſt ruined him. The World is full of ſins, as the Country where <hi>Sampſon</hi> lived was full of <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> theſe ſins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet us every day, and lye in wait to catch us, as the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> did <hi>Sampſon,</hi> now ſome men are ſo wary, that they will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45656:23"/> all companies and occaſions, that may bring them into theſe ſins, and ſeem to be like <hi>Sampſon</hi> ſtrong Chriſtians. Oh but friends, every one of us hath a <hi>Dalilah,</hi> ſome ſin or other of our own in our own boſoms, which we carry about continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with us, and unleſs we beware of this ſin, though perhaps we may keep our ſelves free from all other ſins, yet this at laſt will ruin us. Again, ſuppoſe a man in a Conſumption, this man is very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of all other ſickneſſes, will not enter into any houſe where the Small pox is, will not go near any that are Infected with the plague, keeps himſelf from all other Infectious Diſeaſes, why, you will ſay this man is likely to live; Oh no, he carries his own diſeaſe about with him and within him, and the Conſumpſion lies in his breaſt i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> rotting his lungs, if he have no care of this, this is enough with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other diſeaſe ſpeedily to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with him. Thus is it the duty of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man, that regards the Health and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his Soul, not only to keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from ſins without, but from the ſin within him, not only from the ſins of the times, but from his own ſins. This is the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45656:23"/> ſin the <hi>Goliah,</hi> unleſs this be ſlain, we ſhall never conquer the whole Army of theſe
<hi>Philiſtins;</hi> conquer this ſin, and you ſhall the more eaſily conquer all other ſins, while you keep your ſelves from all other ſins, you only ſhew your ſelves upright in the ſight of men, but he that keeps himſelf from this ſin, his own ſin, ſhews that he is like
<hi>David,</hi> ſincere in the ſight of God.</p>
               <p>And thus you ſee as plainly as I can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs my ſelf; the force and meaning of theſe words,</p>
               <p>I know now you expect that I ſhould give you the Doctrine or Obſervation contained in them, and to give you it in as plain words as I can;
'tis this,</p>
               <p>Doct. That every true and ſincere heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſtian, will above all other things endeavour to keep himſelf from his own ſin, his own Iniquity.</p>
               <p>'Tis a moſt plain truth, but if I may ſpeak without compariſon, the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable truth in all the Bible. Here you ſee the neareſt cut to Heaven, the ſhorteſt path to Glory, the ſureſt way to be ſecure from all other ſins. If a man ſhould keep a Thief in his houſe, and this man ſhould
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45656:24"/> have his pockets pickt every night, and finding himſelf grieved as it ſhould to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it, buy new locks and bars to his doors, and make all the Walls of his houſe ſtrong, that no Thief might enter in; why (you would ſay) this man doth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſimply, he may looſe all his money though his houſe be never broken up, and further (you would ſay) it were his only way to examin the Thief that dwells with him, and put him out of doors: If any of you ſhould have your own houſes on fire, you would not be ſo fooliſh, as to carry buckets of water and fling them on your Neighbours houſes, for fear they ſhould be ſet on fire and neglect your own, why as <hi>Nathan</hi> ſaid to <hi>David</hi> you are the men, People now adays, do wonderfully complain of other men and their ſins, as if they ſhould fear the worſe for them, but look not into their own hearts, and ſee ſin lying and gnawing there, every man ſhould begin at home: If a man hath a Son at home, that is an idle and unhappy Boy, and ſhould break all his Glaſs-win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, you would ſay, this were a ſtrange courſe for this man to go to his Neighbors and complain to them of their idle Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45656:24"/> that do always fling ſtones, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver correct his Child at home, that did him all the miſchief. Friends, I pray let me perſuade you to look into your own hearts, and you ſhall ſee that you have ſome ſin or other there, that doth you all the miſchief, you will ſee then, that the only way for you to get peace and comfort is with
<hi>David,</hi> to keep your ſelves from your own Iniquities. <hi>David</hi> had many Enemies abroad, as his Father-in-Law <hi>Saul,</hi> who ſought his Life; his own Son <hi>Abſalom,</hi> who ſought his Kingdom, but none ſo great as his ſin within him. <hi>Saul</hi> baniſht him from his Court,
<hi>Abſalom</hi> ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht him from his Kingdom, but none brought him ſo much trouble as his ſin within him. 51. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1, 2, 3. oh this was that which broke his bones, nothing grieved him and vexed him ſo much as this; and therefore 'tis worth the while to obſerve the Title of this
<hi>Pſalm,</hi> and when <hi>David</hi> penned it. To the chief Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician a
<hi>Pſalm</hi> of <hi>David</hi> the Servant of the Lord; who ſpake to the Lord the words of this Song, in the day that the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him from the hand of all his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and from the hand of <hi>Saul. David</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:45656:25"/> could never ſay thus before, before he had cleanſed himſelf from his Iniquity within him, he always found one Enemy or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, one trouble or other without him, but when once he had turned his ſin out of doors, then came peace and comfort to dwell with him, ſincerity is the higheſt pitch that a Chriſtian is able to attain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to in this life, and this is the neareſt way to ſincerity, for a man to keep himſelf from his Iniquity. In the proſecution of this truth, I will lay you down and treat of theſe following particulars. I will ſhew you,

'tis like <hi>Solomons</hi> love to his Wives, it was ſo great, that he

<hi>John</hi> Baptiſt he tells <hi>Herod</hi> of his <hi>Herodias,</hi> and
<hi>Paul</hi> when he Preached to <hi>Felix</hi> and <hi>Druſilla,</hi> he reaſoneth of righteouſneſs and temperance, whereby he plainly intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted what was his Iniquity. General Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is as good as no Preaching at all; Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters muſt not only tell People of ſin, but of their ſins. Should a Phyſician come to a ſick man, and diſcourſe learnedly before him of the nature and cauſes of ſickneſs in general, and not tell him what is his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe and ſickneſs, and tell him what means he muſt uſe againſt it, this would do him no good; ſuch are all our Learned Sermons and quaint diſcourſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Brethren, we have to deal with ſinners, ſin in Scripture is a ſickneſs; now we muſt tell every man what is his ſin, and what may be a means to bring him out of the ſnare of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; ſuch general Preaching is like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying in an unknown tongue, which
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:45656:44" rendition="simple:additions"/> the Apoſtle ſaith in the 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 9. is ſpeaking into the air, 'tis Preaching at random. He is not a good Soldier that knows only, how to diſcharge his Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet and let it off, but he muſt be skilfull how to level it that he may ſhoot his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. He is not to be accounted for a good Preacher, that can make a quaint Sermon or a Learned diſcourſe; but if we would do good by our Preaching, we muſt tell every one of his own Iniquities; we muſt not Preach againſt the ſins of the Court in the Country, nor againſt the ſins of the Country at Court; we muſt not ſet men againſt other mens ſins, but every man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his own ſins. The Prophets did not go to <hi>Samaria</hi> to Preach againſt the ſins of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> nor to
<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to Preach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſins of <hi>Samaria.</hi> This will do you moſt good, will make moſt for the health of your Souls.

A man that is in debt, and hath a writ out againſt him, he is fain to hide and keep cloſe, but aſſoon as the writ is out of date, then dare he boldly go abroad, and look the Serjeant in the face; when we are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured,

The myſtery of this ſin working in the heart, and here is no leſs policy than in the former, you ſhall ſee abundance of ſubtlety, and variety of ſtratagems, that ſin uſeth to keep in the heart when once it is gotten in. This ſin I told you before is like an Uſurper or Tyrant, when once 'tis gotten into the Throne, 'twill uſe all the ſubtlety and policy imaginable to keep there, 'twill be an hard matter to get rid of it.</p>

                           <p> 1. It will endeavour all that it can to win upon the heart. The firſt thing a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant doth when he is got to the Throne, is to win the hearts of his Subjects if he can, ſo do ſin, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11. 4.
<hi>Solomons</hi> Wives when they had got his heart, they might do any thing with him, they could then perſwade him to any thing. As a man that hath won another man's heart, O he can deny that man nothing, 14. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6, 7. O
<hi>Herodias</hi> daughter had quite won his heart, her dancing pleaſed him ſo well, and therefore ſhe might have of him what ſhe would ask; ſo ſin quite wins ſome mens hearts, that they are altogether for it, they will not deny it any thing. As we ſay of ſome Servants, they have quite won their Maſters heart for ever, he will never part with them, ſo ſuch Perſons will hardly ever part with their ſins, ſpeak againſt theſe ſins, or Preach againſt theſe ſins, you quite ſtrike them to the heart. O Brethren, take heed of this when ſin in your hearts once comes to get your hearts, then 'tis like to keep poſſeſſion; God muſt work a very great Miracle, ſome wonderful change to part you and that ſin.</p>

4. <hi>Eph.</hi>
                                 <pb n="100" facs="tcp:45656:69"/> 18. As long as ſin can keep the Soul in this poſture, 'tis ſure of it. O Brethren, this is ſuch a ſtrong Fort, that all the Batteries of the Scripture cannot overthrow it. Men that are reſolved to be ignorant, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in their ignorance (as too many do) O how hard a matter it is to convert ſuch Perſons. Now ſin raiſeth this Fort in the Soul theſe three ways.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. It keeps the Soul ignorant of Chriſt and the ways of Chriſt, it will not let the Soul ſee the excellency of theſe things, which are enough to raviſh the Soul. Hence they cry out, 5.
<hi>Cant.</hi> 9. and again 3. <hi>Mal.</hi> 14. when the Soul is thus 'tis far from converſion; there is no talking to ſuch Perſons of Chriſt and Grace, no perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of ſuch Perſons to Holineſs; they love not to hear of theſe things, becauſe they know not the excellency of them.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. It keeps the Soul ignorant of ſin, as to the nature and danger of it. O you ſhall hear People cry out, what harm is there in telling a Lye, in ſwearing an Oath, in drinking a merry Cup now and then, in taking a little pleaſure, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 43. So ſay ſinners, what muſt I be preſently dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for every ſmall ſin, I did but do ſo and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:45656:69"/> ſo, and muſt I dye for it. Thus ignorant People will do all that they can to excuſe and to extenuate and leſſen their ſins, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ignorant of the nature and danger of them; ſome will ſay, they ſee no reaſon why Miniſters ſhould keep ſuch a ſtir about ſuch petty trifling buſineſſes, O 'tis a ſign ſin hath got ſtrong Hold in their Souls.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. It keeps the Soul ignorant of its e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate and condition, it cries peace, peace, when God ſpeaks no peace; Heaven frowns on them, and the Scriptures denounce no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Wrath and Judgment againſt them, 29. <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. O tell a ſinner of ſuch and ſuch ſins, O they will ſay they hope to be ſaved for all that; poor blind Souls, how doth ſin lead them blindfold to Hell. O Brethren, this is a ſtrong Fort, and 'tis hard to ſtorm it, we may Preach and God may ſend his judgments on the earth, and all to no purpoſe, for they will not learn righteouſneſs; O take heed of this; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour all that you can to learn while you have the means of grace continued to you; take pains for knowledge, for while ſin keeps you in blindneſs, it keeps a ſtrong Hold in you.</p>
                              <p>

<hi>Ezek.</hi> 19. we account Caſtles that are built with Free-ſtone, and on Rocks, the ſtrongeſt Caſtles. O, ſin makes it ſelf ſtrong, when it makes it ſelf a Fort, and a Caſtle of ſtone in the heart. Oh! how hard is it to get ſin out of ſuch an heart, 'tis like a ſtone hardned in ſin; lay a Mountain upon a ſtone (ſaith a late Divine) and it never groans, ſo is it with ſinners, let a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of ſin, a World of guilt lye upon his Soul, he feels it not, he groans not under it; ſmite a ſtone while you will, beat it as long as you can ſtand over it, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains not; Oh, reprove ſinners, beat them with the hammer of the word of God, they are not moved at all, they complain never the more of ſin, read 6.
<hi>Hoſea</hi> 5. God hews ſinners by the Preaching of the word as a Maſon doth hew ſtones and cut them, yet are they ſtones ſtill v. 7. A ſtone will not bend nor bow, break it you may, but bend it you cannot; ſo ſinners, let them hear the beſt Sermons, ſit under the moſt powerful Preaching and pathetical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:45656:70" rendition="simple:additions"/> they are like ſtones ſtill, God may break them to pieces with the ſtroaks and blows of his Judgments, yet every piece remains a ſtone ſtill. Oh hard and rocky hearts! how hath ſin fortifyed it ſelf to the purpoſe in theſe hearts; when their hearts are ſo hard, that they are Sermon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, or Ordinance-proof, and Judgment-proof, what ſhall we then ſay of their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                              <p>3. Another Caſtle, Fort, or ſtrong Hold, ſin erects in the Soul, that it may keep the poſſeſſion, is a ſeared Conſcience, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2. Oh, this is an invincible Caſtle, 4.
<hi>Eph.</hi> 19. When a man is not ſenſible of his vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is not aſhamed of ſin, but rather boaſts and glories in it, this is <hi>limen inferni,</hi> the very threſhold of Hell. Reproof's like piſtol bullets, will not enter ſuch coats of mail as theſe; what will they ſay? tell us of Sin and Hell and Damnation? we care not a ruſh for theſe things.

                              <p>3. With prejudices againſt the People of God, and the ways of God: Oh ſay ſome, theſe Saints are the baſeſt fellows in the World, as <hi>Ahab</hi> ſaid of <hi>Michaiah,</hi> I hate him, I can't endure him: Oh, theſe are like Granadoes that carry wild-fire in them, theſe are furious like <hi>Saul,</hi> and breath out threatnings againſt the People of God, and this makes them to hate the ways of God. Brethren, take heed of prejudices againſt the People of God, Oh this is ſins Ammunition in the heart, when it cannot bring a man out of diſlike with Religion, then it ſets him to hate the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Religion. Oh take heed of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring ill thoughts of the Servants of

This very thing, have brought many ſober Perſons to debauchery and wickedneſs, becauſe of their hatred to the Godly, and hath brought many to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake Religion, becauſe they have a preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice againſt ſuch as profeſs Religion.</p>

When ſin hath drawn away the heart from God and Chriſt into evil ways and courſes, then it hinders it from all ways and means of returning to Chriſt: Hence ſinners cry down Preaching, cry down Sabbaths, cry down Ordinances, cry down Prayers in Families; becauſe ſin knows if theſe go up, it muſt come down; ſin bars the doors of the heart againſt any thing that ſhould bring in Chriſt; this is deſperate policy, 29. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.</p>

Oh Brethren, ſin keeps a merry a jovial houſe, to pleaſe and delight the ſinner, and by this ſtratagem keeps the poſſeſſion of his heart; therefore
<hi>Solomon</hi> calls theſe pleaſures the ſong of fools v. 5. Oh how merrily doth ſin carry poor Souls to Hell; alaſs they ſing, but they know not whether they are going, 22. <hi>Iſ,</hi> 12, 13, 14. hardly do ſuch Perſons get rid of ſin, and chain of pleaſures will keep any man faſt. Oh when ſinners once begin to be ſerious, and to think of their Souls and Salvation, then ſin begins to make them merry, to put away all ſuch thoughts out of their minds. I have read in the ſtory of the Life of King
<hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, that the Lords that had contrived the Death of the Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> Unckle to the King, and Lord Protector; after he was condemned, their policy to keep the King from being troubled at his Death,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:45656:74"/> and that he might not pardon him, was to entertain the King every day at Feaſts and Banquets, and with new Plays, Masks and Sports, which they thought pleaſed the King beſt; juſt ſuch is the policy of ſin to ruin our Souls, by entertaining of us with the vain pleaſures and delights of this World, to keep out of our hearts the care of our Souls, the hatred of ſin, and the thoughts of Death and Eternity.</p>
                           <p>Thus ſin hath formerly played its pranks with the old World, and will uſe the ſame policy to deſtroy this World too, 24.

Thus ſin deals juſt like an Harlot, that ſends her Husband from home, while ſhe may entertain her Adulterer with her,

'tis ſome ſin or other, that would fain be ruler in our hearts, that ſends us abroad ſo often; oh let us leave off this trick of cenſuring others, and look to our own ſins, ſet our own hearts in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, we do all complain of ſins in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that bring judgments upon us, but have not we ſome of thoſe ſins in us? do not we harbour ſome of thoſe caterpillars, that devour our Land in our hearts; 'tis worth every man's diligent ſearch and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry;
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:45656:75"/> ſin deals with us in this caſe, like thieves that cry out fire, fire, and ſo call People abroad, and then they get in and rifle their houſes. O Brethren, the beſt of men, they have been the moſt tender of others, and moſt ſharp and ſevere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt themſelves, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 17. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15. theſe were better acquainted with their own hearts, than many of our proud cenſuring Saints now a days. O Brethren, do but try this way, and ſee if you do not get advantage againſt your own ſin. Be as diligent in ſpying out your own ſin, as you have been formerly in ſpying out ſins in others, and talk more bitterly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your own ſins than formerly you have done againſt other mens ſins.</p>

                           <p>7. Another policy is this, when ſin ſees that a man being convinced by the light of the word, goes about to turn it out of doors, then to keep poſſeſſion, 'twill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the Soul thus, that 'tis an impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing for a man to be wholly freed from every ſin in this life, and therefore what need he trouble himſelf about one ſin, as long as he can keep himſelf from other ſins. This was that which deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the
<hi>Phariſee,</hi> God I thank thee I am not as other men, nor as this Publican, he thought it well enough, that he was free from the groſſer ſins; ſo I have heard ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſay when reproved for ſin; and who I pray you is free from one ſin or other. As if God had given every man a pattent to keep one ſin in his heart, ſo he kept no more. Brethren, take notice of it, ſin plays the ſophiſter with you here; and I will ſhew you the fallacy of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:45656:77"/> 'tis true every man hath ſin in him while he is in this life, but it doth not from hence follow, that every man doth keep, allow, and maintain ſin in his heart. A true Saint doth all that he can to be rid of every ſin, though he cannot be rid of it; He is as careful to avoid ſin, as a Traveller is to avoid a Thief, though he may fall into the hands of Thieves for all that. 'Tis ſins policy to be alway be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaguering of us, and beſetting of us round about, but 'tis our duty to be always watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful againſt it, and to do our utmoſt, to turn it out of doors.
'Tis not the bare having of ſin, but the owning of any one ſin, the loving it, the obeying it, the maintaining of it, that will damn a man. And therefore in a Goſpel ſenſe, a man may be perfect in this life and free from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſin, <hi>i. e.</hi> from the countenancing of ſin, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 7, 8,
9. Learn rightly to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this Text. <hi>Bernard</hi> gives us a threefold expoſition of it.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. He doth not commit ſin. <hi>Non pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum facit, quòd patitur potius quam facit.</hi> Sin is ſometimes too hard for him, and ſo he is rather made to ſin than to make ſin; like a Priſoner taken by the <hi>Turks,</hi> he is

A chaſt Virgin may be caught by a man and raviſht or deflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, oh but 'tis as Death to her, but a common Whore, ſhe ſeeks after men 'tis her pleaſure to play the Whore.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. <hi>Non peccat, id eſt, non permanet in peccato;</hi> ſinners like ſwine, they go to the mire on purpoſe to lye down and tumble in it, a Saint if he fall into the dirt, he preſently makes haſt home and waſheth himſelf, and rubs his cloaths and makes himſelf clean. Aſſoon as <hi>Peter</hi> had ſinned grievouſly, he preſently falls to weeping bitterly. A wicked man lives in ſin as a fiſh in the water, 'tis his element, yea he cannot live without ſin.</p>

I ſin ſaith the Apoſtle, yet I hate it
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:45656:78"/> when I do commit it, 'tis not my will to do ſo but my weakneſs. O Brethren, learn theſe things, and ſee the policy of ſin how you muſt avoid it, thruſt it from you, out with it, hate it, abhor it, do not hearken to it, and if any time you fall into any ſin let it be your grief and ſorrow for it; oh do not countenance ſin, becauſe you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be wholly rid of ſin.

Another policy of ſin to keep poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is to tell you of the examples of the Saints, every one of them had their ſins, and yet they went to Heaven for all that, and why may not you keep a ſin as well as any of them, and yet go to Heaven at laſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thus it will tell you of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of <hi>Lots</hi> Inceſt, of

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:45656:78"/> find mercy with God, becauſe ſuch and ſuch did notwithſtanding their ſins.</p>
                           <p>Now to unhamper this ſnare, conſider,</p>
                           <p n="1">1. That theſe Saints, though they did commit thoſe ſins, yet we cannot call them their own ſins as in the Text, they were not beloved ſins, ſins that they took delight in, they did not continue in thoſe ſins, neither did they give thoſe ſins room and poſſeſſion in their hearts; but now if you keep ſin in you, why yours and theirs are not alike.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. 'Tis as vain a thing for a man to make this an argument to live in ſin, becauſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>viz.</hi> the Saints have fallen into a ſin now and then, and obtained mercy, as for me to drink a cup of rank poyſon, becauſe I have heard of one that hath drunk a cup and it did not kill him; take heed of tempting God, becauſe I have ſeen men dance on ropes, ſhall I therefore that have no skill venture to do the like? becauſe I have read, that <hi>Jonas</hi> ſaved his life in the Sea in a Whales belly, ſhall I therefore leap into the Sea, or into a Whales mouth? becauſe God had mercy on ſome, ſhall I therefore deſperately run into the very jaws of fury and vengeance.</p>

None of the Saints in all the Bible ſuffered ſin to keep poſſeſſion, if you would find mercy as they did, follow their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. This is no proper way to hope for mercy at death, by continuing in ſin all our lives; if we do not put away ſin now we are alive, do you think God will take away ſin from us when we are dead, nay rather the contrary, if we ſuffer ſin to live with us, will not God ſuffer ſin to dye with us, 8. <hi>John</hi> 24. O will not Chriſt ſay at the day of Judgment, to ſuch as will not in this life part with ſin, and yet cry for mercy then. O, ſin and you have been old companions, you have lived a long time together, 'tis pity to part you now, and therefore ſin and you ſhall to Hell together; if we keep ſin for our Tenant on Earth, 'tis pity but we ſhould be Tenants to ſin in Hell.</p>

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:45656:80"/> but ſpeak it out, this is the Reaſon; as long as you can but come to Church to hear a Sermon now and then, and to ſay divine ſervice, and Miniſters will but let you come to the Sacrament, you think all is well, you care not for amending your lives, you think not of putting away ſin. O Brethren, ſinners would very fain go to Heaven with their ſins in their hearts, and ſin hath found them out a way, as they think by truſting to their holy duties; O ſaith ſin, what needs thou trouble thy ſelf with Repentance, 'tis but ſending to the Miniſter to pray for thee when thou art a dying and all is well. Friends, this is deep policy, of all things be ſure you learn this Myſtery and take heed of it; ſin will hereby deal with you like <hi>Herod,</hi> mingle your blood with your ſacrifices, if all our waters in <hi>England</hi> ſhould be poyſoned, would it not be a ſad thing; when People drink of them they muſt dye, and if they do not drink, they muſt dye; ſo Brethren, ſin poyſons all our duties, if we perform them we muſt dye, if we do not perform them we muſt dye too; read 66. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 18. the Prayers and the Duties of the wicked, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch as continue in their ſins are an

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:45656:83" rendition="simple:additions"/> luſts and corruptions we have ſubdued al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; and they will perſwade us that now we have done enough, what need we trouble our ſelves any further; this is but one ſingle ſin let it alone, and there be but few that have done as much as you have done againſt moſt ſins. This was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of the young man in the Goſpel that came to Chriſt, whereby his heart deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, O he had done all things but one, and that one thing could he by no means perſwade his heart unto, you ſhall find it 19. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.—22. O his heart deceived him in that one thing, every thing elſe his heart could yield to but not to that one thing; he thought himſelf a very brag fellow that could boaſt of doing ſo much, all theſe have I kept, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo
<hi>Herod</hi> did ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, but one thing he would not do, he would not put away his <hi>Herodias.</hi> O Brethren, let us take heed that our hearts do not deceive us here, in thinking that we have done enough in putting away ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſins, when as we have not put away every ſin, therefore conſider theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. One ſin may damn our Souls, as well as one wound may kill our bodies;
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:45656:84"/> 'tis not enough for a man to ſay I ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dye, for I come not at the fire and therefore cannot be burned, I come not at the water, and therefore cannot be drowned, I look to every thing that I eat or drink, and therefore cannot be poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, I am temperate, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſurfeited, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> O but for all this care there are other ways to take away this man's life; juſt ſo is it here, no man may ſay I ſhall not be damned, for I am no Swearer, Drunkard, Coz'ner, Adulter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Fornicator, Covetous, Prodigal, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Perſon; well thou haſt kept thy ſelf from all theſe ſins and many more, but haſt thou no ſin in thy heart, if there be but one ſin, that may coſt thee thy Soul: What our Saviour ſaid of the ſtate of the damned in Hell, may be truly ſaid of the ſtate of unregeneracy, which is the ſtate of Damnation,
12. <hi>Luke</hi> 59. ſo thou canſt not come out of this ſtate of unregenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, till thou haſt parted with thy very laſt ſin. As no man can take a legal poſſeſſion of an houſe, as long as there is any body of the contrary part in the houſe; ſo Chriſt will not take poſſeſſion of thy Soul, till every ſin be out, no ſin which is of the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:45656:84"/> contrary ſide to Chriſt muſt be there; therefore the Scripture tenders mercy to us only on theſe terms, if we turn from every ſin, 18. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 21, 27, 28. v.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. We muſt part from all thoſe ſins, for which Chriſt payed the price, and ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God the Father. Now Chriſt he ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed for all our ſins, when Chriſt laid down his life, he laid down a ſufficient price for every ſin, now then ſurely we ought not to live in any ſin for which Chriſt dyed. O Brethren, what had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of you and I, and all the World if Chriſt had ſatisfyed the Juſtice of God for all but one ſin. Think of this, whenever you think of keeping any one ſin in your hearts.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. If ever you out-live this one ſin you muſt repent of it at laſt, and why not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at firſt, and if you do repent of it, 'twill be a But to your credit, and a ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh to your good name, 1
<hi>Kings</hi> 15. 5. O you ſee what a great blemiſh that was to that good man <hi>David.</hi>

                        <p n="4">4. Laſtly. Though you do repent of it, yet it will be a burden and trouble to you as long as you live; your eye-ſins (ſaith one) will prove your eye-ſores, and your

No queſtion, but thoſe were ſome ſins that <hi>Job</hi> delighted much in, when he was young, and they were a great trouble to him when he was old. O remember this you that are young, the wounds or bruiſes, that ſome have received when young, they have felt the pain of them in old age, ſo here <hi>&amp;c.</hi> O you know not how many years hence, you may ſmart for thoſe ſins you delight in now.</p>

Thus I have heard Swearers, when they have been reproved for Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, preſently ſay, O God forgive me for it, 'tis a baſe trick that I have got, but I cannot leave it; I do not at all approve of it. Thus I have heard Drunkards ſpeak againſt Drunkenneſs, O they do not love it, 'tis a beaſtly filthy ſin, but they cannot help it, now and then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany will draw them in. O Friends, ſee plainly how your hearts deceive you, you ſay you do not love ſuch or ſuch a ſin, why then do you live in it? if you hate it, why
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:45656:85"/> do you not uſe all means to deſtroy it? if you hate any of your Neighbours, they ſhall be ſure to know it, by one ill turn or other you will do them, why deal you not thus with your ſin you ſay you hate? ſay as <hi>Abiſhai</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> ſhall not <hi>Shimei</hi> dye? do as <hi>Sarah</hi> when ſhe was angry with her maid <hi>Hagar,</hi> preſently out of doors with the Bond-woman and her Child; if you be really angry with ſin, if you hate it indeed you will out with it, but if you will ſtill keep it in your hearts, 'tis a ſign ſin and your hearts are very well agreed; your hearts do but deceive you all this while.</p>

To what purpoſe are all your duties, if ſin be ſafe ſtill, 1
<hi>James</hi> 21, 22. to hear Sermons, and keep your ſins is to deceive your ſelves; ſo to pray againſt ſin and to practice ſin, is to deceive your ſelves.</p>

Now many a man's heart deceives him in this particular, he thinks he is rid of the ſin, becauſe he doth not actually commit it: O this is a great deceit. And therefore know this, though a man may have no hand in it (as we ſay) yet if he hath an heart in it, 'tis enough to make him guilty before God; we have
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:45656:86"/> an example of this in <hi>Saul,</hi> he had no hand in <hi>Stephens</hi> death, he did not caſt a ſtone at him, he was only a looker on, O but he lik't it very well, he conſented to it, that was enough, <hi>Acts</hi> 22. 20. God looks to the heart, feels which way the pulſe beats; a man may never have killed a man in his life, yet he may be a murderer in his heart, he may wiſh his enemies death, and ſo a man may never be drunk and yet a drunkard, if he love to ſee others drunk, if that be his ſport and delight. As we call a man a hatter, that never made an hat in all his life, only becauſe he keeps a ſhop furniſht with hats; or an hoſier, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo though a man never committed ſuch or ſuch ſins, yet if his heart be filled with them, 'tis all one in the ſight of God, hear what our Saviour ſaith, 15. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. why ſaith one, from the hand proceeds murders and thefts, from the eye adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and fornications, from the tongue falſe witneſs and blaſphemies, O but the heart is the forge of all; therefore Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, take heed your hearts do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you here, and make you think that you are not guilty of any ſin, becauſe you do not commit it. Obſerve that place well
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:45656:87"/> 17. <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. when God comes to puniſh our ways, he ſearcheth our hearts, 'tis not enough to caſt ſin out of the life, if it be not turned out of the heart; this is to thruſt one out of the Hall, and bring him into the Parlour; we muſt not only leave of committing but alſo loving ſin.</p>

Thus our hearts will perſuade us according to the Proverb, over ſhooes over boots. Thus <hi>Peters</hi> heart deceived him, after he had denyed Chriſt once, he then makes no bones of it to deny him again and again, and forſwear him too. As ſometimes by eating, we get a ſtomach to eat more, ſo by committing one ſin, we do as it were get us a better ſtomach to commit more ſins, after the firſt draught, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps we may a little breath at it, ſin the

O Brethren, take heed of this deceit, 'tis no policy in the World to give ground to ſin; ſuch a cunning wreſtler keep it off at arms length, if it once come to cloſe and get in, we are ſure to fall, and therefore to prevent this deceit, let us make uſe of the Apoſtles remedy againſt anger, as a ſoveraign balm againſt every ſin, 4. <hi>Eph.</hi> 26, 27. come out of ſin preſently, aſſoon as we are fallen into it. O let us not make that an argument, becauſe we have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted one ſin weakly, therefore to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit two ſins willfully.

                        <p>1. Here is very great odds againſt us, two againſt one, ſin without, and our own hearts within us; ſin battering, and our own hearts betraying of us. Each of theſe ſingly is too hard for us, but when
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:45656:92"/> both combine together againſt us, in what a caſe are we? ſin that corrupts our hearts to betray us, and our hearts they conſpire with ſin to deſtroy us. O ſirs, look in what a dangerous condition we are in. That Garriſon is not like to hold out long, when there is an Army in the Field be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieging it round about, and Traytors with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Walls and Fort among themſelves. Thus ſin deals with us as the

O ſo doth ſin ſet an ambuſhment for us, while we are fighting againſt ſins Army without (<hi>viz.</hi>) Temptations, then the lyers in wait our own corruptions they begin to riſe againſt us; ſo that you ſee we muſt fight with both hands, the battel is before and behind; O ſirs we muſt look to it, for evil is determined againſt us. <hi>Paul</hi> had the tryal of this, and he ſets down his own experience in this caſe, 7.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 18. O ſaith he, I am in ſuch a ſtrait, I am ſo put to it between two enemies that fight againſt me at once, that I know not how to perform the good I would do, and he gives us the example verſe 21. there is ſin without beſets him, and you ſhall ſee another enemy within, verſe
23.
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:45656:93"/> this makes him cry out for help, verſe 24. and the help he finds verſe 25. O Brethren, you ſee there is great danger; <hi>Hercules</hi> durſt never encounter with two at once, but every Saint muſt, therefore keep al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways one eye ſhut againſt the Temptation, and the other eye always open to watch over your own hearts.</p>

As for example, a man may ſeem for a while to beat off the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, by abſtaining from the outward Act and Commiſſion of a ſin, yet if this man's heart be not changed he will to this ſin again. A man that is a Swearer or a Drunkard, may be ſo far perſwaded of the evil of theſe ſins, that for a while he may leave off theſe ſins of Swearing and of Drunkenneſs, nay when he is tempted to them, as when he is provoked, as at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times he will forbear his Swearing and Curſing; when he is invited to the

As for example, one man he loves drinking at his heart, another loves gaming at his heart, another loves adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery at his heart, another loves money and gain at his heart, ſo that he cares not how he comes by it ſo he have it. O Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, judge you your ſelves, are not theſe in a dangerous condition. O kill their luſts and you kill their very hearts,
'tis hard for ſuch Perſons to be converted; when their ſins are nearer to their hearts, then their Souls and they love them bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than their Salvation, ſuch Perſons are in a dangerous Eſtate.

<hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin</hi> be out of his ſight, O ſo will many venture rather to ruin their Souls and loſe all, than put ſin away. O this is the hardeſt leſſon that Chriſt can teach to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny our ſelves, and yet we muſt learn it if we would be Chriſt's Diſciples.

The danger is great likewiſe in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the occaſions of ſin; our corrupt hearts will be always drawing of us into the occaſions of this ſin; we are all of us like little Children we love to be in harms way; we love to keep within ſight of the Temptation occaſions, ſaith Mr. <hi>Dike</hi> a reverend Divine, are the taps to give vent to our corruptions; we do as it were broach theſe unclean Veſſels our filthy hearts, when we ſeek after occaſions of ſin; O this is very dangerous, you ſhall ſee it in the example of <hi>David, David</hi> you know was an upright man, and ſin had a mind to wreſtle with <hi>David</hi> to try a fall with him, and how goes ſin to work, why thus, that which ſin would have <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> do was to commit adultery with <hi>Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheba,</hi> now
<hi>Davids</hi> heart muſt draw him into the occaſion of this ſin, elſe nothing could be done, his ſin and his heart go cunningly to work to draw him on to it, and ſo they did at laſt; you ſhall ſee it, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi>
11. 2, 3, 4. ſee how cunningly <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was drawn into this ſin, only by not avoiding the occaſion of it, <hi>David</hi> muſt walk on the top of his houſe to view a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, he little thought whether he was

O Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, let us learn to have a care of the very occaſions of ſin. The Scripture com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us as ſtrictly to avoid the occaſions of ſin as ſin it ſelf, 25. <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. why ſome perhaps would ſay, what harm is there in this, as long as I do not buy and ſell by them, O but ſaith God, thou ſhalt not keep a falſe weight in thy bag, 'tis a great occaſion of ſin, and 'twill draw thee into ſin at laſt, ſo 23.
<hi>Prov.</hi> 31. what harm is that, O if thou look on it, there will be taſting and ſipping of it at laſt, remember <hi>David</hi> did but look on <hi>Bathſheba</hi> at firſt, and you know what followed; ſo in the 1. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle of <hi>John</hi> 5. Chap. 21. 'tis not only keep your ſelves from Idolatry, but do not keep ſo much as an Idol, that will prove occaſion to Idolatry, ſo 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 22. O that all thoſe who blame others for being too preciſe and ſcrupulous, would take notice of this. Occaſions of ſin are the ſhooing-horns to draw us on to ſin,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:45656:96"/> and in this reſpect 'tis very dangerous to yield the leaſt inch to our corrupt hearts.</p>

                        <p>6. The danger is very great likewiſe, becauſe our hearts are the beſt weapons we have to fight againſt ſin, as long as the heart is ſound with God, ſin cannot ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily prevail, but now when our very hearts turn traytors and deceivers, how hard a matter is it to oppoſe ſin; you may ſee the truth of this in other things, that which a man's heart is ſet againſt, 'tis a very hard matter if not altogether impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to perſuade him to it, but when a man hath ſet his heart to do a thing, you may draw him to it eaſily with a wet fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger as we ſay.
'Twas the eaſieſt thing in the World, to perſuade <hi>Judas</hi> to that great and horrible ſin of betraying Chriſt, when his heart was once ſet upon it. 13. <hi>John</hi> 27, and 30. verſes, mark it, aſſoon as the Devil was entred into <hi>Judas</hi> heart, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently goes about his work, the Text ſaith he went out immediatly; ſo if ſin once get into our hearts, our hearts will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly draw us into ſin. The Devil could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver tempt <hi>Eve</hi> to eat the forbidden Apple, till he firſt had made her in love with it, then ſhe preſently falls aboard with it, and

<hi>Solomons</hi> Wives had not first turned his heart, they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have turned <hi>Solomon</hi> to Idolatry. O Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, 'tis a very dangerous thing, when ſin and our hearts are both againſt us, when our hearts are both againſt us, when our hearts once begin to lean to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſin. A ſtrong and great Tree, if it once be leaning on one ſide it is the ſooner blown down, ſo when our hearts are lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downward, ſin and temptations then do blow us quite down. O look to your hearts, ſet your hearts againſt ſin what you can; when a man's heart is fully bent one ways, 'tis not all the World can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade him to the contrary, 119. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 128. obſerve it which way <hi>Davids</hi> heart was bent, to God's precepts, that made him to hate ſin, not only abſtain from ſin but hate ſin.</p>

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:45656:97"/> while a man loves ſin in his heart, he will never repent of it truly and ſincerely, and therefore the Scripture requires the heart as the main thing in converſion, 11. <hi>Acts</hi> 23. where the bent and purpoſe of the heart goes, that's the way that a man goes that's his rode. Now a man that is riding a journey for a friends company, may ride a mile or two out of his way, or to ſee a great Town may ride a little out of his way, but he turns into his old rode again, ſo a ſinner his rode is to Hell, perhaps to ſtop the mouth of Conſcience, or for fear of the Laws, or to pleaſe a Godly friend he may abſtain a while from ſin, and ſo turn out of his rode, O but he will into his old rode of ſin again, till the heart be truly changed a man is never truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, nor ever truly repents of ſin; on the other ſide when a man's rode lyes to Heaven, he is bent thither with full pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of heart, though perhaps by reaſon of a temptation or weakneſs, he fall now and then into ſin and perhaps groſs ſins, yet he turns into his rode again, <hi>Peter</hi> aſſoon as he had ſinned preſently repented.

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:45656:97"/> that he was out of his rode, preſently turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into his rode again. O Brethren, from hence you may gather what an hard nay impoſſible thing 'tis for a man, whoſe heart and ſin can cloſe together, for ſuch a man while ſuch to repent and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, conſider then your hearts, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to know your own hearts which way they ſtand affected, which way the frame and bent, and purpoſe, and edge is turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and if it be thus that ſin and they are not utter enemies, know that your Eſtate is very dangerous, that as yet you never have truly repented, nor is it poſſible for you, unleſs your hearts be changed ever to repent.</p>

                        <p>Anſw. 1. You muſt know, that we are all of us born Hypocrites, for we have all of us the ſeeds of this ſin, as well as of all other ſins in our natures; but though e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one, Saints as well as Sinners (as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more ſure) have Hypocriſie in
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:45656:101"/> them, yet it doth not follow, that all are in a ſtate of Hypocriſie, or Hypocrites in ſtate as we ſay, ſo that as a late Divine Doctor <hi>Harris</hi> obſerves, the Queſtion muſt not be whether Hypocriſie be in you, for that you may be ſure of, but whether Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie reigns in you; for know this for your comfort, that if you diſcern Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie in you, and you bewail it, loath it, abhor it, and labour all that you can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, ſure it doth not reign in you; we may apply that particularly to this ſin of Hypocriſie, what the Apoſtle ſaith of ſin in the general, in the 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon your ſelves dead unto ſin, <hi>i. e.</hi> in a ſtate of grace, O but who may account himſelf ſo, or when may a man reckon ſo and reckon right? the Apoſtle tells us verſe the 12. if ſin do not reign in you, 'tis a ſign you are in a ſtate of grace though ſin be in you. This is the Goſpel account of it; juſt ſo may we ſay of Hypocriſie, if Hypocriſie do not reign in us (though there may be ſome Hypocriſie in us) yet we may in a Goſpel ſenſe account our ſelves to be no Hypocrites. To make this plain to you, there is a Riſing or Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>England</hi> againſt the King, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:45656:101"/> come into this Town, here they quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they lye in our houſes, eat of our meat and drink of our beer, yet if we do not entertain them willingly, but 'tis full ſore againſt our minds, we do what we can to be rid of them, we openly teſtifie againſt them we are not to be accounted Rebells; ſo is it with this ſin of Hypocriſie or any other ſin, though it will abide in us and with us, yet if we hate it, and labour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, and would fain be rid of it; God will not account us, as Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites.</p>
                        <p>2. 'Tis a good ſign of ſincerity and true grace, for any man to complain of his Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie. Hypocrites they are always boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their ſincerity; and therefore, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites are like Ranters, which wear more ſilver lace on their backs, than they have ſilver in their pockets; they boaſt of their holineſs, <hi>i. e.</hi> their external holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when as they have not a drachm of true grace in their hearts; the beſt of men have always the worſt thoughts of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Holy Mr.
<hi>Bradford</hi> would many times ſubſcribe himſelf in his Letters,
<hi>John</hi> the Hypocrite, and a very painted Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, ſee what
<hi>Agur</hi> one of the wiſeſt men
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:45656:102"/> ſaith of himſelf, <hi>Prov.</hi>
30. 33. <hi>Job</hi> an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right man, yet ſee <hi>Job</hi> 42. 6. But now on the other ſide, the Hypocrite doth all that he can to juſtifie himſelf, you may know who is an Hypocrite by this, that man that will not own himſelf to be an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite. And therefore as the Hypocrite is never the better for juſtifying himſelf, ſo a good Chriſtian, a ſincere heart is never the worſe for condemning himſelf, 18. <hi>Luke</hi> 13, 14.</p>
                        <p>3. The beſt rule to judge of our Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie is by our love, do we love any ſin, why then our heart is not upright with God? though we commit many ſins and great ſins, yet if we do not love them nor delight in them, 'tis our grief that we do commit them, this is a ſign of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity. As <hi>David</hi> could ſay, I hate eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry falſe way, though he could not ſay, I have kept my ſelf from every falſe way.
<hi>David</hi> committed many a ſin, yet <hi>David</hi> never loved any ſin; why, his heart was ſet upon God. A true Saint, when he hath committed any ſin, he will cry out as the wandring Traveller, O I am out of my way, pray ſet me into it again. <hi>Peter</hi> was no Hypocrite, though for fear he
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:45656:102"/> denyed Chriſt and forſwore him; O'twas not his mind to do ſo, he did it out of fear, full ſore againſt his will, and it coſt him many a bitter tear for it. <hi>Judas</hi> he was the right Hypocrite, he made it a ſet plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted buſineſs to betray Chriſt, he did it with his heart, and then he thought to ſmooth all over with a kiſs at laſt. Thus you may ſee what is Hypocriſie, and learn how to judge of your ſelves or others, that is not Hypocriſie when a man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains how bad he is, but when a man would fain ſeem to be better than he is, that's Hypocriſie when a man would co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a wicked heart under an Holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
                        <p>4. A word of advice to ſuch who are thus grieved and troubled for their Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie; know for your comfort that this is but a Temptation of the Devil, who envies the inward joy and peace of a good Conſcience, and therefore ſeeks by all means to blank and diſturb you, and as it is a temptation, ſo be careful that it doth not drive you from your duty; the Devil hath much prevailed this way, and many have cryed out, why ſhould I pray, or hear, or read, or go to the Sacrament,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:45656:103"/> why I am an Hypocrite, 'twill be all in vain, God will never accept of me nor of my duties, take heed of ſuch a thought as this; do your duty, keep on your way though it be your grief, you cannot do better, endeavour to do your beſt, and let this be your comfort you would fain be better and do better. Follow the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Prodigal, in the
15. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18, 19. the Prodigal might have thought thus with himſelf, why ſhould I think of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to my Father, can I ever think my Father will own me, that have been ſuch a Wretch to ſpend all that he gave me ſo vainly and fooliſhly, and to run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from him, yet you ſee he is reſolved to go, and you ſhall ſee the event to your comfort, verſe the

                              <p n="1">1. A pricking wounding influence, 'tis ſuch an influence as makes a man ſenſible
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:45656:108" rendition="simple:additions"/> of his condition; every man by nature hath a ſpiritual kind of lethargie, ſuch a Diſeaſe in his Soul as the num-palſie is to the Body, he is quite ſottiſh and ſenſleſs, hath not ſo much as the underſtanding of a bruit, to know whether it be well or ill with him, knows not whether he belong to Chriſt or the Devil, is not ſenſible that he is in danger of Hell. Now this is the firſt power and influence of the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to bring a man to his right ſenſes, to make him underſtand his condition, 2. <hi>Acts</hi> 37. here the word reacht to the quick, before they were not ſenſible of what they had done. O Brethren, there be many that never felt this pricking, wounding power of the Ordinances, never yet were made ſenſible of their conditions, that think all is well with them, and hope to be ſaved as well as the beſt; O if once they were but pricked to the heart, how would they roar and cry out, how would they be ſtarted at it, to ſee the miſery they are in.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. An humbling influence; when a man is ſenſible of his loſt condition, then he begins to be humble, he will never be humble till now; poverty will bring a
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:45656:108"/> man upon his knees; O then what will ſuch a conviction as this is do, when a man ſees that he is ready to drop into Hell, that he muſt endure the wrath of God to all Eternity. O this makes the Soul hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and pliable before God, the man now is like melted wax, God may work him how he pleaſeth, command what he will he is ready to obey,
9. <hi>Acts</hi> 6.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. A ſtrengthning influence; after the word hath weakened the power of ſin in a man, then it ſtrengthens the Soul with grace, as Phyſicians when they have throughly purged their Sick man, and ſo made him weak, then they give him ſtrengthning meats; ſo the word conveys Faith and Hope, and other ſtrengthning graces into the Soul; ſo 'tis ſaid of <hi>Paul</hi> after his Humiliation, 9. <hi>Acts</hi> 22. and ſo he prays for the <hi>Epheſians</hi> in the 3. <hi>Eph.</hi> 16. Now this ſtrength the word conveys to the Soul, from the ſpirit of Chriſt to ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him againſt ſin, and all other oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions whatever to an holy life, 1.
<hi>Coloſ.</hi> 10, 11.</p>
                              <p n="4">4. A comforting influence; this is the higheſt of all, when a Soul is comforted under the Ordinances, and is filled with
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:45656:109"/> joy and delight, and abundance of ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, 2. <hi>Cant.</hi> 3, 4. now is the Soul as it were in Chriſt's Banqueting Houſe, or Houſe of Wine, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Soul rejoyceth, and is glad of the preſence of Chriſt, like <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt in <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Womb leaps and skips for joy. Thus it is with many a Soul under the power and influences of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, as thoſe converts, 2. <hi>Acts</hi> 37. there's pricking, but what follows? read the 46. verſe and you will ſee.</p>
                              <p>2. Conſider and examine your ſelves, whether you have felt none of theſe influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences under the Ordinances; perhaps you have not felt the comforting influence, O do not ſay therefore that there is no influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, perhaps you find little or no ſtrength, yet ſay not 'tis in vain, the means of grace are in vain to my Soul; have the word humbled you, have it pricked your hearts and made you ſick of ſin, and ſenſible in what a loſt condition you are in by nature, bleſs God for that, and wait ſtill on him in the ways of his Ordinances, you ſhall find comfort at laſt; you muſt not expect to come to the higheſt pitch preſently, as our Quakers do, aſſoon as any turns Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, preſently he is full of joy and comfort
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:45656:109"/> as his heart can wiſh, ſuſpect ſuch a thing as not the work of God, God will have us throughly humbled before comfort comes in. <hi>Naaman</hi> was bid go into
<hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> ſeven times and waſh, now if <hi>Naaman</hi> had after the firſt or ſecond waſhing come out of <hi>Jordan,</hi> and finding himſelf not cleanſed, left the waters and ſaid there was no vertue in them, would you not ſay the fault was his own.

                        <p n="1">Anſw. 1. Conſider what is the work of converſion, 26. <hi>Acts</hi> 18. you ſee that the ſtate of converſion is a ſtate of light; when a man lies in a dark dungeon, he ſees not the dirt and the ſpots and filth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his cloathes, nor the vermine and naſtineſs about him, but bring this man into the light, and then he will ſee every ſpot, and all vermine crawling about him. A man before converſion he is quite in the dark, nay darkneſs it ſelf, 5.
<hi>Eph.</hi> 7, 8. now what can darkneſs ſee? hence it is that 'tis ſo hard a matter to perſuade a wicked man that he is a ſinner, he will not believe it, though he be drunk every day and ſwear every minute, yet this man will not be perſuaded, but he is a good

<hi>i. e.</hi> brought into the light, O then he will complain of himſelf as the vileſt creature living, now he ſees more ſin in him than ever he did.
<hi>Paul</hi> before his converſion what he thought of himſelf he tells us,

<hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15.</p>

As a man that is quite under water, feels not the weight of all the Tuns of water on his back, but let him come out and take but a ferkin of water on his ſhoulders, and he will feel the burden; ſin is like a <hi>Bee,</hi> let it alone, ſuffer it to crawl about your hands or face, and you cannot tell whether it hath a ſting or no, but anger it or beat it off, and it will ſting you preſently. A man is ſick and while he feeds the diſtemper he feels not much pain, but let him take Phyſick to drive out the diſtemper, then he grows ſicker and ſicker, becauſe the Phyſick is contending with the diſtemper, doth that man think he is worſe than he was before? ſo here, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                           <p>(1.) By its root. (2.) by its fruit. Repentance in Scripture is compared to a tree; the tree hath roots but they lye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ground every body cannot ſee them, but when we ſee a tree ſtand againſt many great winds and ſtrong blaſts, and when
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:45656:113"/> we ſee it green and flouriſhing, we may know it hath good roots, 'tis well rooted, again our Saviour tells us, a tree is known by its fruits, and therefore we muſt look to theſe two.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. There is no ſinner in the World but abſtains from ſome ſins, yea hates ſome ſins; go to the Covetous man, and ask him to go to the Tavern and there to revel it and ſpend his money, O he will tell you he cannot endure this drinking and tipling, 'tis an offence to God to ſpend and waſte our Eſtates ſo vainly; go to the Drunkard and tell him of Covetouſneſs, O he cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure this hoarding up of money, he loves to ſpend it freely, 2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 22. lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part. <hi>Judas</hi> a covetous Wretch, he pleads for Charity to the Poor, 12.

When the Scripture gives us the Character of a true Saint, it doth not deſcribe him by leaving of ſuch or ſuch particular ſins; but by forſaking ſin in the general; 1. <hi>Job</hi> 1. he eſchewed evil, <hi>i. e.</hi> he avoided every ſin; ſo repentance is a turning from every ſin, 26. <hi>Acts</hi> 18. every ſin is darkneſs, now if a man turn from every ſin but one, yet he cannot be ſaid to turn from darkneſs, becauſe that ſin is darkneſs; take a piece of cloath that hath twenty ſpots of dirt, and waſh away nineteen of them, yet you cannot ſay that cloath is clean, why becauſe there is a ſpot of dirt in it; no more can you ſay that man is a Saint, that reforms many things if he live but in one ſin.</p>

                     <p>Though the ſeveral reaſons of the Doctrine laid down already might ſerve as ſo many ſtrong convincing motives againſt this ſin, yet becauſe it is a ſin of ſo much delight to us, and of ſo much difficulty to get rid of it.

                     <div n="1" type="motive">
                        <p>1. Keep your ſelves from this ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis a beloved ſin; this hath been proved already in the Doctrinal part, that 'tis the ſin that we love moſt dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Now if it be ſo, a ſin that we love therefore let us caſt it out; this is the Goſpel Rule, if ever we would be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, we muſt love that which we natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally hate, and hate that which we na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally love. A natural man hates the light and loves darkneſs, hates God, loves the World, hates Chriſt, loves ſin, now if ever this man be ſaved he muſt be brought to this, to hate what he
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:45656:136"/> loved, and to love what he hated, he muſt love the light and hate darkneſs, he muſt love God and hate the World, he muſt love Chriſt and hate ſin. Now here lies the ſtrength of the motive, if there be any ſin that we love we muſt hate it, caſt it out becauſe 'tis beloved of us; 'tis our love to this ſin, that makes this ſin ſtick and cleave ſo cloſe and ſo faſt to us, 8.
<hi>Cantic.</hi> 7. ſo may we ſay here many waters, many tears, yea whole rivers and floods of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance can ſcarce drown our beloved ſin.</p>
                        <p>Here are three things eſpecially to move us to caſt out this ſin upon this very account that 'tis our beloved ſin.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. We love it; what love ſin? do you know what you do when you love ſin? ſin is communion with the Devil, and do you love communion with the Devil? there is none of you all but would be ready to ſpit in my face, if I ſhould tell you you love the Devil, and you love his company; why yes, if you love any ſin you love communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Devil.

                           <hi>dicit? de amatoria cupidine. ſcapu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la.</hi> Now the Devil he loves ſin, and if you love ſin too, here is your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Devil; what ſaith the Apoſtle to the
<hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 20. He that worſhips an Idol as the Heathens did, he hath fellowſhip with Devils; he that loves any ſin ſets up an Idol in his heart, and ſerves and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips this ſin as much as the Heathens did their Idols, therefore he hath fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with Devils; you ſee what it is to love ſin; to keep a beloved ſin in ones heart, is to have fellowſhip and communion with Devils; all the Devils in Hell, riot, and feaſt, and make mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in that man's heart. Are you not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of this, O then let this be an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to caſt out this ſin, becauſe 'tis a beloved ſin.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If we love any ſin we cannot love Chriſt, this ſin will make us leave him and forſake him. <hi>Judas</hi> his beloved ſin made him betray Chriſt, O what an horrid thing was that; and Brethren, are there not many <hi>Judaſſes</hi> in the World, that will betray Chriſt to ſatisfie their beloved ſin. Every man that hath a
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:45656:137"/> beloved ſin in his heart, is a very <hi>Judas</hi> in his heart to Chriſt, let Chriſt and his ſin ſtand in competition, and you ſhall ſee that man will be the greateſt enemy to Chriſt, 3. <hi>Philip.</hi> 18. but who were theſe, ſee verſe
19. here were their Gods their beloved bellies, and their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved earthly things, their beloved ſins, theſe were Chriſt's enemies, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi>
4. 10. what's the reaſon <hi>Demas</hi> forſook Chriſt, why his beloved ſin made him, he loved the World; what ſaith Chriſt, 6. <hi>Matth.</hi>
24. ſo is the caſe here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and Sin; he that loves ſin hates Chriſt, and he that loves Chriſt hates ſin; the reaſon of this is plain, Chriſt comes to deſtroy ſin, therefore he that loves ſin cannot endure Chriſt, and ſin that diſhonours Chriſt, therefore he that loves Chriſt cannot but hate ſin. Chriſt and Sin are like <hi>Caeſar</hi> and
<hi>Pompey—nec ferre partem Caeſarve priorem Pompeiusve parem</hi>—ſin will not endure Chriſt to be above it, and Chriſt will not endure ſin to be equal with him. Now here's a tryal of your love, are you reſolved to love ſin, then you muſt part with Chriſt? are you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:45656:137"/> to love Chriſt, then you muſt part with your beloved ſin; conſider ſeriouſly of this, whether a beloved ſin will countervail your loſs of Chriſt.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. We cannot honour Chriſt better, than by parting with our beloved ſin; O the Lord Jeſus will take this very kindly at our hands; when a man ſhall ſay, Lord I have a ſin, a luſt within me, that I love moſt dearly, 'tis my darling O I take great pleaſure and delight in it, 'tis not all the World ſhall make me part with it, but Lord at thy command I leave it, rather than I will offend thee I will have no more to do with it, yea rather than I will not love thee, I will hate even my beloved ſin. O Brethren, Chriſt will take this wery kindly at our hands; O that every one of us could ſay ſo! as the Martyr ſaid when he was wiſhed to recant and ſave his life, no ſaith he, if every hair on my head were a life, I would lay them all down for the ſake of my Lord Chriſt, ſo ſhould we ſay, if every hair on our heads were a beloved ſin, we would part with them all for the ſake of Chriſt. Here is a true ſign of an upright heart, and there
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:45656:138"/> is no other ſign of it, for a man to leave other ſins it ſignifieth little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but when it comes to our belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſin, whether we will part with our <hi>Benjamin</hi> or no, herein will our love to Chriſt be tryed, 22. <hi>Gen.</hi> 11, 12. ſo will Chriſt ſay, O my dear Soul, now I know that thou loveſt me, ſeeing thou haſt not withheld thy ſin, thine only ſin, thy beloved ſin, but haſt even part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that for my ſake. O Brethren, you will ſhew more love to Chriſt, and reſpect to Chriſt in parting with this one ſin, than with a thouſand other ſins. And thus you ſee there is great reaſon, why we ſhould keep our ſelves from our own ſin, upon this account, becauſe
'tis our beloved ſin.</p>

                     <div n="2" type="motive">
                        <p>2. A Second Motive is this.</p>
                        <p>This ſin our own Iniquity, is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing that hinders the making up the match between Chriſt and our Souls, were it not for this Chriſt, and we ſhould quickly agree and cloſe together, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out more ado; the ſinner ſtands upon this Lord ſpare me in this one thing,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:45656:138"/> no Chriſt will not bate thee this one ſin.

Thou wilt not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Chriſt; why? becauſe thou wilt not part with this ſin; and Chriſt will not accept of thee; why? becauſe thou wilt not part with this ſin. O but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps thou wilt ſay, I have many ſins more; why let not that trouble thee, Chriſt will accept of thee with all thine infirmities, if thou wilt but part with thine Iniquities, 11. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. if thou art weary of ſin, go to Chriſt he will eaſe thee, haſt thou thouſands of ſins, if thou diſown them, Chriſt will never diſown thee for them. Here Brethren, is all the pinch when a man will own ſin, and love ſin, and keep and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſin, that's the Soul that will not cloſe with Chriſt; come then ſinners let us examine the caſe a little; what is there between Chriſt and you, let us try whether we can reconcile you toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no; come ſinners ſpeak, what is it that Chriſt would have you do? why
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:45656:139"/> 'tis only this to keep your ſelves from your own Iniquities; well, and what's the reaſon you will not do this? why will you not part with your ſins? O do not ſtand with Chriſt for ſo ſmall a matter as a ſin; O let it never be ſaid that a ſin parted you and Chriſt, that a ſin kept you out of Heaven; why, do in this caſe as in other caſes of leſſer moment, put it to reference, and chooſe whom you will to umpire between you and Chriſt.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Let reaſon decide the controverſie, 1.
<hi>Iſaiah</hi> 18. Chriſt you ſee is willing to ſtand to this.

Brethren, if you will but read the Scriptures and ſtand to their determination, they are infallable and will not deceive you, you will not ſtand out for a ſin any longer; but perhaps you will ſay of the Scriptures, as <hi>Ahab</hi> of <hi>Micaiah,</hi> they ſpeak not good concerning you but evil, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
                        <p n="3">3. We will chuſe another umpire, a
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:45656:140"/> boſom friend of yours, and that is your own Conſciences, refer the buſineſs to Conſcience, and ſtand to what your own Conſciences ſhall determine. Hear what Conſcience ſaith,
13. <hi>Job</hi> 26. <hi>Job</hi>'s Conſcience told him, that ſin was a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Pill, a thing not to be beloved, 38. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. ſo will Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, read you the ſame leſſon if you would but appeal to it. And let me mind you of one thing; though you will not hearken to the voice of reaſon, nor to the voice of the word, yet you muſt hearken to the voice of Conſcience either ſooner or later, if you ſlight it now 'twill roar againſt you another day; do but conſider the caſe of <hi>Judas,</hi>
27. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3, 4, 5. <hi>Judas</hi> might have argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thus before, what ſhall I be ſuch a fool to leave Chriſt for thirty pence, O but he goes on without Scripture Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Conſcience, and after 'twas done, O what an Hell was Conſcience to him, it drags him firſt before the Chief Prieſts, and there Conſcience condemns him, it drags him next to the Gallows, and there Conſcience executes him, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that it drags his Soul to Hell, and
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:45656:140"/> there Conſcience torments him to all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. You ſee Brethren, what <hi>Judas</hi> got by his ſin, O there is none of you but will be ready to ſay, better <hi>Judas</hi> had parted with his ſin, than with his Saviour; in condemning <hi>Judas</hi> you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn your ſelves, you that ſtand with Chriſt for one ſin, for one luſt, mark, this will ſerve you at laſt as <hi>Judas</hi>'s ſin ſerved him, if you leave it not 'twill bring you to Hell.</p>

This aggravation heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens it above that horrid ſin of the <hi>Jews</hi> in Crucifying Chriſt, 3. <hi>Acts</hi>
14, 15, 17. verſes, nay Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, if they had known it they would not have done it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 8. But this is an high aggravation of ſin to know it, and yet to commit it. All that <hi>Paul</hi> could plead for his bloody ſin was his ignorance, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. If
<hi>Paul</hi> had known it to be a ſin, he would not have done it for all the World, 26. <hi>Acts</hi> 9. But what canſt thou ſay for thy ſelf, O ſinner, that ſinneſt againſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, thou that knoweſt ſwearing to be

O this makes this ſin abominable, becauſe we commit
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:45656:144"/> it with deliberation; an holy man may commit a ſin in a paſſion which he hates, O but theſe they ſet their thoughts and their wits a work to commit this ſin; the Scripture always condemns deliberate ſinning, 4. <hi>Prov.</hi> 14, 15. What ſinners? O deliberate ſinners, they are expreſſed two ways (1) by contriving ſin, foreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting it on their beds, verſe 16.

                        <p n="4">4. 'Tis an heart hardning ſin, other ſins defile the heart, but this hardens a man's heart againſt all reproofs, admonitions, checks of Conſcience, and all means of Repentance whatever; this is another great aggravation of this ſin, this was that which was the ſin of
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> God had ſent him meſſage after meſſage, and
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:45656:145"/> yet all would not do, becauſe his ſin had hardned his heart, this provoked the Lord to deſtroy him. O ſinners tremble at this, hardneſs of heart will aſſuredly bring de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; there are two terrible Texts to this purpoſe, 9.
<hi>Job.</hi> 4. 29. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. hear this you that have been told of your ſins and yet will not leave them, have had meſſage after meſſage, Sermon after Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, reproof after reproof, and yet all is nothing, you keep your own Iniquities ſtill, O tremble to think that your hearts are hardened to your own deſtruction.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. 'Tis a ſin that makes us ſlight and contemn all the Judgments of God; as long as we keep this ſin in us, all afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will do us no good at all, 27. <hi>Prov.</hi> 22. mark it, his fooliſhneſs
<hi>i. e.</hi> his ſin, we have two notable examples of this;
<hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam</hi> you know what was his ſin, the Scripture calls it ſo the ſin of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> God ſends a Prophet to cry againſt him for it, what doth he? ſee 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13. 4, 6. mark it he prays that his hand may be reſtored, not his ſin mortifyed, 'tis a ſign his heart was not humbled by this Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as appear likewiſe verſe 33. the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is King
<hi>Ahaz</hi> 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 22. O Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:45656:145"/> take notice of this when afflictions will work no good upon you, O this is the aggravation of your own Iniquity; for any other ſin, O how will God's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments humble us and make us leave them, but this our own Iniquity, 'tis not all the ſtorms and tempeſts whatever will make us caſt them over-board, O ſinners look on your ſelves you that have had great ſickneſſes and great afflictions, and yet you retain your own Iniquities ſtill, the Swearer his Swearing the Drunkard his Drunkenneſs
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> O 'tis a fearfull ſign that God hath rejected you as 'tis ſaid of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 6. <hi>Jer.</hi> 29, 30.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. 'Tis a ſin of cuſtom that's another great aggravation of it. O Brethren, once committing a ſin is enough to ſink any of us to Hell, as once ſwearing, once lying, once cozening, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but to make a cuſtom of it, how can we expect mercy. Is a Thief Arraigned for Fellony, and 'tis proved that he hath been a Thief ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years, he hath made it his trade and cuſtom, the Judge will condemn that man preſently without any favour, never put ſuch an Old Rogue to his Pſalm of mercy. O then what is it to make a
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:45656:146"/> trade and cuſtom of ſin; other ſins we may ſay men commit only by the bye, but this their own Iniquity,
'tis their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry trade and cuſtom, there is a dreadfull place, tremble at it you that have lived in any known ſin many years, 13. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23,

                        <p n="7">7. 'Tis a ſin that we take the greateſt delight in, that's another aggravation of it; to commit ſin is ill enough but to take pleaſure and delight in ſin, O that is moſt horrid. Is it not grief enough to a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that his Son will do what he would not have him, but to delight to vex his Father, O this is the height of undutiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; ſin in Scripture is called a grieving of God, a vexing his Holy Spirit, now they that delight in any ſin, delight to vex God; the Apoſtle reckons theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons among thoſe that are rejected, or given over by God to themſelves the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Judgment of all, 1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 28, 32. and Chriſt threatens them, 1. <hi>Prov.</hi> 22, 31. ſo 2. <hi>Prov.</hi> 14,

                        <p n="8">8. 'Tis a ruling ſin, that's another great aggravation of it. O Brethren, do you not tremble at this to have a
<hi>Beelzebub</hi> in your hearts, the Prince of Devils, the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:45656:146"/> King of ſins; ſuch a man hath the curſe of <hi>Cham</hi> lighted upon him, to be a ſervant of ſervants, his other ſins are ſervants, all of them to this Iniquity this great
<hi>Beel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub,</hi> and he himſelf is ſlave to them all. O what a caſe is that man in, that is ſervant to his ſin, his luſt, whatever work his ſin ſets him about he muſt do it, there is no King in the World hath ſuch a power over his Subjects, as ſin hath if it gets once to rule, ſin will make a man hang himſelf, or drown himſelf, or cut his own throat; experience is witneſs, and therefore the Apoſtle exhorts us eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially againſt this ſin upon this account, 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12, 13. whatever you do, do not keep a reigning ſin in you.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. 'Tis a ſin that muſt be maintained at an high rate; a man's own Iniquity will bring him as we ſay to skin and bones, how many have waſted all their Eſtates to ſatisfie their luſts, and afterwards have been fain to go a begging, ſo the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal. Nay 'tis not Eſtate and Body will ſerve the turn, this ſin will ruin the Soul too. O tremble ſinners to think of this, God hath given you fair Eſtates in the World, God hath given you healthy Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:45656:147"/> God hath given you reaſon to rule all the Creatures in the World, above all God hath given you Immortal Souls, and will you ſpend all theſe upon ſuch a bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage as ſin is.

The great aggravation of all is this, that this ſin comes neareſt of all ſins to that great tranſgreſſion the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt; as we ſay of ſome things they are ſo cold, as that if they were but a degree or two colder they were rank poyſon; ſo this ſin had it but two drams more, 'twere the very ſin againſt the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, and that is malice and final im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency.

<hi>Pſal.</hi> 11.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Now is the match fully concluded

Brethren, this is both an unſpeakable Myſtery, and alſo an unſpeakable Mercy, for a poor Soul to be united to Chriſt, O if ſinners knew this, they would never keep a ſin more in their hearts.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Now can the Devil do you no more miſchief, the Devil may roar and tear, and fret, and fume, but he can do that Soul no harm that is united to Chriſt; O what an happineſs is this to be freed from the power of the Devil! when a man hath caſt out his own Iniquity, then is the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils Caſtle demoliſht, and his main engine broken to pieces, 10.
<hi>Luk.</hi> 17, 18. Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Goſpel that curbs the power

<hi>Job</hi> 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24. as
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:45656:155"/> a Father takes out the ſting out of a Snake or Adder, and then gives it to his little Child to play with it, ſo when ſin is purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, then all the afflictions our Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father ſends us, are like Adders without ſting or poyſon, he knows they will not nor cannot hurt us, we may then play with them, 9. <hi>Gen.</hi> 12, 13, 14. Obſerve it, God makes a Bow the ſign of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; O but that is rather a ſign of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; no, 'tis a Bow without an Arrow; ſo are all the miſeries of the People of God in this World like the Rain-bow, 'tis a Bow without an Arrow, there is no anger nor wrath in God againſt them.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Now are you fit for death, and now may you triumph over death; caſt out this ſin, and then cry O Death where is thy ſting? This is the work and buſineſs that will chear up your ſpirits upon your Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beds, this will make you look merrily up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Friends that come to you, merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the World you are leaving, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily upon Death with whom you are to wreſtle, and merrily upon Chriſt to whom you are going. O will a Soul ſay then, I would not have this ſin in me now for a thouſand Worlds, though once I was
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:45656:155"/> loath to part with it, and could be hardly perſuaded to it.

                        <p>Now put theſe things together, would you have Chriſt to embrace you, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil to be afraid of you, all afflictions to work good for you, would you live mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, dye comfortably, then caſt out this your own Iniquity.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. Look back to thy Baptiſme, there thou haſt promiſed and alſo ſworn to Chriſt to forſake ſin, and haſt thou an own ſin a dear ſin that thou keepeſt, thou art a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſworn wretch; Baptiſme is a ſeal of the Covenant between God and thee; now thou muſt either deny ſin or deny thy hand and ſeal to Chriſt.

                     <p>But before I preſcribe or ſet down the ſeveral receipts or antidotes, that may ſerve as a counter-poyſon againſt this ſin, it will be neceſſary to put one Queſtion to you, and that is this, are you willing to part with this ſin? if you be but willing, I dare warrant you a cure, but if you be not willing, all the Miniſters in the World
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:45656:161"/> may Preach out their lungs in vain to you.</p>
                     <p>But perhaps ſome of you will ſay, this is a ſtrange Queſtion, why do you put ſuch a Queſtion to us? what do you think of us? do you look upon us as mere Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, do you think we are not willing?</p>
                     <p>Hear me and I will ſhew you as ſtrange a Queſtion as this, that our Saviour put to a man, 5. <hi>John</hi> 6. This is a very ſtrange Queſtion if you conſider three particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The ſickneſs of this man; it was a Palſie, a ſickneſs that makes a man's life both a burden to himſelf and to all that are about him; now to ask ſuch a man, or indeed to ask any man that is ſick, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would be healed, were one would think a ſtrange Queſtion.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The length of his ſickneſs; Eight and Thirty Years, one would think a man that hath lien bed-rid ſo long, ſhould be ſo weary of his diſeaſe, that he need not be asked this Queſtion, wilt thou be made whole?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The place where he lay at the Pool of
<hi>Betheſda,</hi> the place of cure, he came or was brought thither on purpoſe to be
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:45656:162"/> cured; why then doth our Saviour ask him this Queſtion, whether he would be made whole? Brethren, here is enough in theſe three particulars to make you to wonder at the Queſtion; yet conſider 'tis our Saviour Chriſt puts the Queſtion, and ſurely there is more in it than we can ſee at firſt ſight, for Chriſt the wiſdom of the Father would not put forth an unneceſſary or unprofitable Queſtion; and therefore there are divers expoſitions of it, I will name (and only name) ſome.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Wilt thou be made whole? <hi>i. e.</hi> wilt thou uſe the means to be made whole? many love the cure that hate the means; every body loves health, few love Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. While this man lay ſick he was an object of pity and charity and might get much alms, if he were whole he might looſe them; the Queſtion is wilt thou be made whole? that is, art willing to looſe what thou getteſt by thy ſickneſs to be made ſound.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. He had been ſick ſo long, that now his ſickneſs was grown to be almoſt a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond nature to him, and it did not trouble him ſo much as at the firſt, he had forgot
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:45656:162"/> the price of his health; ſo that the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is wilt thou that haſt layen ſo long ſick be made whole.</p>
                     <p>I will name no more.</p>
                     <p>Now to apply this to our preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; there is every one of you hath one ſin or other, that is your particular ſin or ſickneſs of your Soul, and you have lien under the power of this ſin many a year, ſome Thirty, ſome Forty, or Fifty, or Sixty, or Eighty years; nay more you come to theſe waters the Ordinances, you lye at <hi>Betheſda</hi> under the means of grace, as if you deſired to be rid of ſin, yet ſtill the Queſtion is, will you be made whole? will you part with this Iniquity? I know you will all anſwer, yes, you are willing to part with ſin; O but ſtill the Queſtion is will you be healed?</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Do you love the means, are you wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to make uſe of ſuch means as the Lord preſcribes you in his word for the good of your Souls? can your hearts anſwer to this Queſtion, whatever the Lord bids us do we will do it? like ſetting Dogs that hunt eagerly to catch the fowls, but will rather ſtarve than eat any of them; ſo many hunt after Sermons but not do them. Do you
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:45656:163"/> endeavour to practiſe all the Sermons that you hear; if you hear Sermons but do not practiſe them, 'tis a ſign you are loath to part with your ſins.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Are you willing to forego whatever pleaſure, or profit, or advantage ſin brings in to you, that you may be healed of it? O can your hearts anſwer to this Queſtion; there be many that ſay they hate ſin, yet love the pleaſure, profit, and wages of ſin. Brethren, if you love not the meat, why do you eat of the broth? if men love not hanging, why do they love ſtealing? do as <hi>Zacheus</hi> did, 19. <hi>Luk.</hi> 8. if you would turn ſin out of doors, turn all its lumber out of doors too.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Have not cuſtom in ſin made you unwilling to part with ſin? have you not lived ſo long in ſin, that you do not know now how to live without it? have you not forgot the price of Salvation and the worth of your Souls? O you that have been ſinners ſo many years, you that are Swearers of Fourſcore years ſtanding? are you willing to leave your Swearing? you that are Drunkards of Threeſcore years ſtanding? are you willing to leave your drinking? you that have been covetous

                     <p>I have already in the doctrinal part laid down nine ſeveral remedies or receipts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this ſin, which if you would but make uſe of might work the cure, but leaſt you may have forgot them, I will add a few more and lay them down before you as plainly and as practically as I can, ſo that if after all this you ſtill retain your own Iniquities and go to Hell, you ſhall thank your ſelves for it.</p>

Again I ask you further, what do you think of Sermons? I know what
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:45656:164"/> you will ſay here alſo, why if we did but practiſe what we hear we might do well; well then is this your verdict? is this your judgment? this comes out of your own breaſts, do as you ſay and you may cure your ſelves; you ſay were you in
