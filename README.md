 the ſmart and burden2. That man that hath kept himſelf from his own Iniquity, he is one that hath duly conſidered the gr3. That man that hath kept himſelf from his own ſin, will endeavour to keep others from their ſins a4. That man that hath turned his own ſin out of his heart, will be much in aggravating of it what he5. That man that hath renounced his own ſin, will live ever after in a quite oppoſite and contrary c6. That man that keeps himſelf from his own ſin, will be leſs in cenſuring others for their ſins. An7.
